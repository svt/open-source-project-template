= Introduction

We gratefully accept contributions via
https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/[pull requests].

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions.
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well
as others who are interested in this solution.

== Changing the code-base

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your
own fork, and then submit a pull-request. This is often called the https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962[Fork-and-Pull model] 

* All contributions to this project will be released under the inbound=outbound norm, that is,
 they are submitted under the projects main license.
* By submitting a pull request or filing a bug, issue, or
 feature request, you agree to comply with this waiver of copyright interest.
 Details can be found in the link:./LICENSE[LICENSE].
* All new code should have associated unit
tests that validate implemented features and the presence or lack of defects.
* Additionally, the code should follow any stylistic and architectural guidelines
prescribed by the project. In the absence of such guidelines, mimic the styles
and patterns in the existing code-base.

=== Signoff and optionally Sign each Commit

As part of filing a pull request you agree to the DCO.
https://developercertificate.org/[Developer Certificate of Origin] 

A DCO is a lightweight way for a contributor to confirm that they wrote or otherwise have the right
to submit code or documentation to a project. 

To confirm that you agree to the DCO, you need to *sign off* your commits when sending us a pull request. Technically, this is done by supplying the `-s`/`--signoff` flag to git when committing:

`$ git commit -s -m "add fix for the bug"`

Optionally, you can also sign the commit with `-S` which also gives your commit a nice verified button on GitHub,
It requires that you have a GPG keypair set up, see https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/signing-commits[Sign commit on GitHub with GPG key]


`$ git commit -s -S -m "add fix for the bug"`

For the difference between signoff and signing, see

== Git History

* Consider following the Conventional Commit standard: https://www.conventionalcommits.org

* We pay more attention to the quality of commit messages. In general, we share the view on how commit messages should be written with
 https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches[the Git project itself]

* https://github.com/git/git/blob/e6932248fcb41fb94a0be484050881e03c7eb298/Documentation/SubmittingPatches#L43[Make separate commits for logically separate changes.]
For example, pure formatting changes that do not affect software behaviour usually do not belong in the same commit as changes to program logic.

* https://github.com/git/git/blob/e6932248fcb41fb94a0be484050881e03c7eb298/Documentation/SubmittingPatches#L101[Describe your changes well.]
Do not just repeat in prose what is "obvious" from the code, but provide a rationale explaining _why_ you believe your change is necessary.

* https://github.com/git/git/blob/e6932248fcb41fb94a0be484050881e03c7eb298/Documentation/SubmittingPatches#L133[Describe your changes in the imperative.]
Instead of writing for example, "Fixes an issue x with encoding" prefer "fix encoding issue x" or "fix: encoding issue x was fixed" (Conventional Commit style). Think about it like the commit only does something _if_ it is applied. 

Thank you for reading and happy contributing!
